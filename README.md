## Building and Installing from Source

This project requires CMake (>= 3.15) to generate platform-specific build files.
Ensure CMake is installed before continuing with build instructions for your platform.

Once CMake is installed and configured, you're able to build Laye's source. Simply create the build tree with CMake and then have CMake build it.

```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```
